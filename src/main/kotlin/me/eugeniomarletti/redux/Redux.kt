     * You may call [dispatch] from a change listener, with the following caveats:
     *
     * 1. The subscriptions are snapshotted just before every [dispatch] call.
     * If you subscribe or unsubscribe while the listeners are being invoked, this
     * will not have any effect on the [dispatch] that is currently in progress.
     * However, the next [dispatch] call, whether nested or not, will use a more
     * recent snapshot of the subscription list.
     *
     * 2. The listener should not expect to see all state changes, as the state
     * might have been updated multiple times during a nested [dispatch] before
     * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
     * registered before the [dispatch] started will be called with the latest
     * state by the time it exits.
